Project : How and why cassava resists the virus ?

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34842800/

The production of cassava is threatened by the geminivirus South African cassava mosaic virus(SACMV), which causes cassava mosaic disease.

Cassava landrace TME3 (West Africa) shows tolerance to SACMV, while T200 (South Africa) is highly susceptible.

Chloroplast proteins seem to play a role in tolerance in TME3.

RPL10 (Sac52) is a known key player in the NIK1-mediated vector triggered immunity (ETI) response to geminivirus infection, indicating a possible role for Sac52 in SACMV recovery in TME3.
