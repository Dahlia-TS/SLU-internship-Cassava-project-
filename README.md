Project : How and why cassava resists the virus ?

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34842800/

The production of cassava is threatened by the geminivirus South African cassava mosaic virus(SACMV), which causes cassava mosaic disease.

Cassava landrace TME3 shows tolerance to SACMV, while T200 is highly susceptible.

Chloroplast proteins seem to play a role in tolerance in TME3.

RPL10 is a known key player in the NIK1-mediated e ector triggered immunity (ETI) response to geminivirus infection, indicating a possible role for Sac52 in SACMV recovery in TME3.

Cassava landrace TME3 shows tolerance to SACMV, while T200 is highly susceptible. Chloroplast proteins seem to play a role in tolerance in TME3.
